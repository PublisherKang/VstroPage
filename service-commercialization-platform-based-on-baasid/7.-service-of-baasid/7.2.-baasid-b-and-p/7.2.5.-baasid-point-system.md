# 7.2.5. BaaSid Point System

The point system is a system in which partners use BAAS tokens when they need points or tokens within their platform or receive a new point system from BaaSid.

The point system provides customized point services that are already used in the agenda platform, one of BaaSid's services, and can be easily operated and managed through the dashboard.

It is a service separate from BaaSid B\&P, but after receiving the point system, partners can use BaaSid B\&P and freely select and use bridges, payments, and markets.

In order for partners to use BAAS as points, they can use it through a contract with BaaSid, and must purchase the quantity to use as points.

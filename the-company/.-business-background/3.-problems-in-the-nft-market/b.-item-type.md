# B. ITEM Type

NFT is not a finished market, but a starting stage. The structure of the business model is very simple, and the focus is on a distributed ledger that proves ownership of digital assets rather than special technologies, and thus images that can be easily implemented digitally is occupies most of item.

Currently, through NFT, various business projects such as collectible games, sports stars' cards, and images that give artistic value have been created and sold at high prices, but so far the focus is on works and game items rather than digital assets.

Therefore, the current NFT business model does not deviate significantly from the transaction concept using images such as games, collections, sports, metaverse, and art, 3D models, and videos, and does not present the value of actual digital assets and it hasn't presented a completely different new type of item yet.

**Potential Risk**

(a) Before deciding to purchase and participate in the Token, we recommend that you read the following carefully and fully analyze and understand the factors and risks involved. Risks include, but are not limited to:

(i) Risk of storage-related buyers' negligence, such as restriction of access to Token due to loss of identification and loss of essential personal keys related to digital wallets stored Token.

(ii) Risk of changes in value after the publication of Token due to global market and economic conditions. We may not be able to fund the development of the Minti ecosystem or maintain the Minti ecosystem in its intended direction due to this uncertainty in Token value.

(iii) Risks associated with changes such as changes in the political, social, and economic environment, changes in the stock or cryptocurrency market environment, changes in the regulatory environment of the countries in which we and our affiliates operate, and changes in their ability to survive or compete in such environment. Existing/new regulations on blockchain technology that are disadvantageous to Token can be applied in certain jurisdictions, which can lead to significant changes in Minti ecosystem and projects, such as Token abolition/loss.

(iv) Risks related to changes in the future capital needs of us and our affiliates, and changes in the availability of capital and financing to meet them. Lack of funding can affect the development of the MINTWAY Platform and the use and potential value of the Token.

(v) Our platform activities may be suspended, disbanded, or launch plans may be suspended for various reasons, such as adverse changes in Token value, business relationship failure, or competitor's intellectual property rights claims during development/operation.\
And this may negatively affect the Minti ecosystem, Token, and the potential use of Token.

(vi) Risks related to the lack of interest by companies, individuals, and other organizations in the MINTWAY Platform and services and the limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. This lack of interest may limit funding or affect the development of the MINTWAY Platform and the utilization and potential value of Token.

(vii) Risk of applying significant changes to key features and specifications of the Token or MINTWAY Platform prior to the launch or implementation of the MINTWAY porject and the Minti ecosystem. The MINTWAY intends that the capabilities of Token and MINTWAY will be consistent with the contents of the Whitepaper, but these changes are nonetheless applicable.

(ix) Risk of interfering with MINTWAY Platform infrastructure and Token utilization by intentionally or unintentionally planting harmful or malicious codes on MINTWAY Platform by third parties or other individuals. The blockchain used in the platform is also vulnerable to such attacks, so it poses a risk to the operation of the platform and related services.

(x) The occurrence of catastrophic events such as natural disasters by force majeure may affect our and our affiliates' business operations and other factors beyond our control. Mining attacks, attacks by hackers or other individuals may result in theft or loss of Token sales revenue, theft or loss of Token, and impairment of Minti ecosystem development capabilities.

(xi) Token and other cryptocurrencies are new, unproven technologies and are continuously evolving. The full functionality of Token is not yet complete and there is no guarantee of completion. As technology advances, advances in encryption technologies and methods, changes in consensus protocols and algorithms, and so on can pose risks to Token, MINTWAY porjects, the Minti ecosystem, and the use of Token.

(xii) Token grants no decision rights to any other entity regarding the MINTWAY porject, the Minti ecosystem, us, etc. All decisions, including discontinuation of products, services, Minti ecosystem, etc., additional creation, sale and liquidation, etc. of tokens utilized in the Minti ecosystem, are made in our sole discretion.

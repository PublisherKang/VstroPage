As everyone knows, the National Development Council has long supported blockchain and other cutting-edge companies. It established the Taiwan Blockchain Alliance. Currently, it has included about 80 industry players, forming an industrial force that cannot be underestimated. At the same time, the establishment of a national-level blockchain has also begun to have a voice and legitimacy due to the introduction of the government and the needs of enterprises.

In addition, the specifications also require the addition of three application demonstrations of DID distributed identification service applications, hardware wallets, and cross-chain interoperability. With the national high-speed network center in Hsinchu, Taichung, and Tainan, as well as the most powerful high-speed computing power in Taiwan, this will be the prototype of the long-awaited Taiwan national chain in the blockchain industry.
